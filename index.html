        <h1>A Little About Me:</h1>
        <a>I took some classes in High School with computer coding and web design and it has sparked my interests in
          technology in general. I have very basic levels of programming but I have always wanted learn more but never
          had the formal opportunity to be taught computer languages. I currently work for telecommunication company
          that does technical support for Apple computers and products. I've worked there for just over a year and a
          half which has driven me to become even more interested in coding and the field of technology. I heard about
          this program from a friend and decided that this would be a perfect opportunity to progress my knowledge and
          help me continue towards my goal of working in a field with computer coding.
