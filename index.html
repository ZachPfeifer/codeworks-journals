    <h1 style=color:red>Hello My Name is Zach</h1>
    <p>
      <a>I took some classes in High School with computer coding and web design and it has sparked my interests in
        technology
        in
        general. I have very basic levels of programming but I have always wanted learn more but never had the formal
        opportunity to be taught computer languages. I currently work for telecommunication company that does technical
        support
        for Apple computers and products. I've worked there for just over a year and a half which has driven me to
        become
        even
        more interested in coding and the field of technology. I heard about this program from a friend and decided that
        this
        would be a perfect opportunity to progress my knowledge and help me continue towards my goal of working in a
        field
        with
        computer coding.</a>
