        <h1>A Little About Me:</h1>
        <a>I took some classes in High School with computer coding and web design and it has sparked my interests in
          technology in general. I have very basic levels of programming but I have always wanted learn more but never
          had the formal opportunity to be taught computer languages. I currently work for telecommunication company
          that does technical support for Apple computers and products. I've worked there for just over a year and a
          half which has driven me to become even more interested in coding and the field of technology. I heard about
          this program from a friend and decided that this would be a perfect opportunity to progress my knowledge and
          help me continue towards my goal of working in a field with computer coding.

        <h2>Week To Update:</h2>
        <p>Week to I really struggled with figuring out what to put inside a function. I still feel as though I am
          struggling with this but more and more as time goes on I am able to realize what kinda things can be used in a
          function. One of the major things I learned or came to an understanding on was Nesting Conditional/If
          Statements in side eachother. While doing Free Code Camp I went over Nesting items but it wasnt until we did
          the popsicle stick activity did I fully realize the scope of it. I am most excited on learning how to refactor
          my code to shorter lines and learning shorcuts in general for logic statements.</p>
